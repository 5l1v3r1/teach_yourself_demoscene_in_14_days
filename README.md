## Day 1 - What's a demoscene

The [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) is an underground computer art culture.

We call demosceners the folks with too much free time that like to use their computers and make digital art to be released on this so called demoscene.

Demosceners often use nicknames to identify themselves and hang around in so called demogroups. Some demosceners are active members in multiple demogroups, with or without using the same nickname.

Demoscene has no comercial purpose. The releases are meant to show the limits of the machines and the technical skill of their makers. There are no rules to what kind of release you can make. Some are made as technical benchmarks, others as conceptual art, others just for fun. It is entirely up to you to explore what you like doing and share it with other demosceners.

Demoscene releases come in many different shapes and forms:
* tracks, audio pieces in rendered or executable formats
* pixel graphics, drawn images with fixed resolutions and/or palletes with restricted number of colors
* demo, an audiovisual realtime executable for a certain machine
* limited size intros, a single executable file with all assets generated by the executable under a specific filesize limitation (popular sizes: 256bytes, 512bytes, 1kb, 4kb, 8kb, 64kb)
* animation, rendered graphics videos

Releases typically occur at [demoparties](http://www.demoparty.net/). Demoparties come in many flavors but they are usually 2 or 3 day events that bring together demosceners and ask them to participate in a series of competitions. The entries are shown on the big screen, people vote what they liked best, and some guys get to take symbolic prizes home.

Your mission, should you should to accept it, is to make your first demoscene entry, meet fellow demosceners, participate in the compos at a demoparty and eventually "bring a big shock to japanese brain".
